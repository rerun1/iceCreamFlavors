## Description
Web page lists america's favorite ice cream flavors. Rather than writing the flavors in the HTML, a JavaScript loop inserts the flavors into the page from an array.

<br>

## Objectives
- [X] JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- [X] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- [X] Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- [ ] Application implements a for loop and works as expected.
All previous objectives have been met.
- [ ] Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- [X] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [x] Practice styling with imagery and fonts
